Hey hey,

Happy 3rd anniversary, Bubba! Time really flies fast noh? Parang kelan lang magkikita pa lang tayo for the first time sa pinaka iconic na gas station natin. Haha. Here we are at 3 years. We had our highs and lows, our relationship and patience tested, and challenges along the way, but even though it brings us to our lowest, I will never ever give up on you and us. My life is already yours and yours alone. I am here to stay and that will never change. I know I still have a lot to work on, and I promise that I will always prove to you that I am worthy to be by your side. It's been 3 long years but I still yearn for you every single day, and I think I would never get enough of you kahit na araw araw na tayo magkasama. I feel like a life time with you would still be too short for me. Just thinking about all the things that we can still experince along the road excites me, may it be good or bad, as I know it will help us to learn and grow together. I will never miss the chance to make you happy, and will never miss the change to help you with anything you need. I know we also have our individual lives to take care of, and I just want to say that I am a proud witness of how resilient you are. But I also want you to know that we have each other to rely on. We are in this together no matter what it may be, and no matter how hard it gets, I always got your back. I am your partner through thick and thin, through heaven and hell, forever and always. The dream of being with you permanently drives me to be better and fuels me to work harder. I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you and fullfill all our goals and dreams together. But for now, I look forward to the day where we can spend this day together. I love and miss you so much, Bubba.

Your Bubba
